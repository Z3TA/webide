Prioritize: bug fixing, then some polishing and maybe some optimization.
Don't implement new stuff until we have a stable release!
Try do debug without console.log!
Always use F5 to reload! Or exit functions might not fire!

Currently working on:

When one key bound fails to return (there's an error) all after it also dont run.

When writing in the functionlist not all matches get highlighted

Double '' when writing in text.

Auto-complete from all opened files (global variables)!

Remove all text marked as miss-spelled when toggling the spellchecker off.

file_tabs not med när editorn byter fil.

Opening files with weird formatting: files inside .hg for example, try binary files!

Indentation for good looking multidimensional arrays:
var arr = [
[1, "foo"],
[2, "bar"],
[3, "baz"]
];


Clicking 4 times to select with {} match doesn't work, stops at first }.


Tab framför </table> (ska inte vara det)


Function args wont come up in autocomplete.  

Function help hinting doesn’t go away when typing.

Auto-complete inside a function-name seems to auto-complete itself!
function foo..

Autocomplete function arguments inside the function!



Polishing
=========

It's hard to see if a file is saved or not!
A better confirmation/indication that the file has been saved.
Better looking file

Auto load/connect to the debugger so that we can more easely find editor errors. Self debugging.

goto_file.js: Seach in subfolder option, ignore dot filder and folders option. Better coloring.

A key command for closing a file.

A list of all key-bdings available, F1!?

Also show the indention helper if we pasted in something and the last char was a {

xmatch: do not count { inside strings.

Write letter starting in center!? 
Bigger chars in xmatching.

Colors when parsing next text next to a html tag, it turns blue </>

Moving file tabs, change position.

When the state (file.text == last saved state) mark the tab as saved.

Allow context menu everywhere, or at least on the file tabs too.

Reopen last closed file tab.

Switch file-tab positions

A "check" sign when toggling stuff (if its on or off) in the context menu (right click).

* Auto insert .. } if it makes sense to do so.

* Really need to warn if there is = inside an if() !!

* Some sort of block helper: when for example inserting in if-statement, the indentation get lost.
Show a ruler or something!? When there is not a matching count of {} in the document.
ex: {{<--
}

* When editing plain text it would be nice to be able to have spaces/tabs for indentation!
Example, when making a dot list. Or should the editor do that to!?

Set opening folder at startup to last opened folder.


Annoying flashing yellow when opening a file.

Context menu (right click) doesn't disappear when saving As
Auto complete file names when editing href or src 
Auto complete markdown lines ---- and ==== to fit (same length) as text above.
Add words like href, src, etc to the spell-checker ignore.

Don't insert double ' inside comments

Auto remove mathching } when removing an if statement.

Show big fat warning if = inside if( a = b) instead of ==, always a bug!
Also warn when  you use == outside an if!?

Indent inside if's
if(word.length > 0 && 
				htmlTags.indexOf(word) == -1 && 
				jsKeywords.indexOf(word) == -1 && 
				!isNumeric(word) &&
				fileExtensions.indexOf(word) == -1) {

Do not overwrite line-nr with chars-in-margin!


Spell-checking is laggy


				
Add words to the spellchecker, using context menu

Files dont have tabs ...

When devmode = false, error -> confirm("An error was descovered ... Do you want to report?")

Don't mark file as changed if it has the same state as the last saved state.

Make the highlight ({}) character red if there is no match.

Make the scrollbar on the function-list lighter so that it doesn't steal focus from the code

The tabs steal focus from the code ... make them lighter!? Or change the coding area!?

automatically scroll down to the function, when you type in the function list (when there are MAAAAAny funtions)

No color on high-light, just bold! paren + m�sving

Har to see what tab is opened. Make it yellow!

confirm button before "replace in files" and a report of how much got replaced!

Increase search input box when there is a long string

The tabs look funky, changes places when you switch tab, and are on multiple lines, when the window is too small.

Use a session file(s) instead of storing stuff in localstorage. Ex. JZedit/timemashine/filename.txt/date

auto-complete variable names!

fonts: Consolas,Menlo,Monaco,Lucida Console,Liberation Mono,DejaVu Sans Mono,Bitstream Vera Sans Mono,Courier New,monospace,sans-serif

Better search in file. Like Nodepad++

prettify the zoom heading labels. (show line number)

Optimization
============

Running the spellchcker will throttle the CPU at maximum for up to 30s or more!

Deleting selected text is Sloooow.

Editor became un-responsible when searching for: smoothing

It lags while moving the character (arrows) in a large file.

Deleting a selection is slow!!

Inline functions in jsParser.js (make a better document previewer before that!? *smile*)

Wait some times before starting a parse. (dont have to parse while we're typing, most of the time). 

Do the grid boxes really have to know their character index!?

Test a huuuge .js file with many functions to see how the editor performs.

Typing is slow, especially in full screen.

Rendering is slow when there are many misspelled words.

Render only the row when typing along ...

Go to Power Options -> Create a power plan -> Change advanced power settings and set CPU Maximum Rate to 5% or how much you need.

Hide lag by rendering before doing work.

editor.renderPart(row, col, length); // Render part of the grid 

Can we get rid of the file.text and only use the grid!? Only convert the grid to text when saving. 






Unable to repeat bugs (happens rarely)
---------------------------------------

Text disappears from some lines when the spellchecker is running.

when closing:
Error: File='C:\Users\Z\dev-repositories\js-editor\plugin\javascript\jsParser.js' not open! global.files=["C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\todo.md","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\plugin\\find_replace.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\plugin\\mouse_select.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\File.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\test\\html.htm","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\plugin\\mouse_place_caret.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\test\\A.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\test\\test.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\plugin\\render_text.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\settings.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\index.htm","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\plugin\\render_indentation.js","C:\\Users\\Z\\dev-repositories\\js-editor\\editor.js"]
file_tabs.js:636 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'isSaved' of undefined
---

Pressing enter mess up the colors

Somtimes keys with shift or alt-gr doesn't work! native

Sometimes you get an error when closing the editor, that one of the file we want to save state for is not in global.files.

When reloading using F5:
node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 close listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit.
use location.reload() instead!?

Somtimes when closing the editor. The file path is already removed from global.files!

Sometimes get error about file not being open, when closing a bunch of files: file_tabs.js:618 

Editor sometimes fails to save!!! When? there's an error / something crash?

Sometimes when undoing (ctrl+Z) the caret is placed on a non existing grid column!

Black screen when opening file

Ctrl+X not working

Opening files with inconsistent line breaks.

Opening another file shewed the div's so that preview dropped down and canvas halved. When!???

Test if inlining functions in jsParser makes it faster.






Feature
-------

Show help for standard JS methods like: text.substring( show: start, end

Drop file into editor!!

Give a warning when doing this: options.push[something]; when "options" in an array (should be .push() a method)

optioin (menu option) to Add misspelled words to dictionary overload.

More help with huge {} block nesting, detect problems, show warnings triangles!?

Auto insert */ when typing /* in JS mode.

A key to move something to the right *over* existing code. ex: place A|B xxxxxxxxx B <--- here

A faster way to open files: Ctrl + G, goto line or file:line (insipration: Chrome debugger)

When there is no file open, show a list of file? or a text: <p>Press <b>Ctrl + O</b> to open a file</p>

Increase text size by Ctrl + Scroll wheel. (for presentation mode)

Mark unused variables (and properties)

Better search in file. Look at notepad++ for inspiration.

Dumb autocompletion: Auto-complete words that we have already typed.

Cltr + P: Type somthing to open any file (like in debug tools)

When one or more lines are selected while pressing tab, make it a code block, insert { arount it } and place the caret to the left of the first one

Keybinding-override: A GUI for over-riding all keybindings, lets you edit the key's for all functions in global.keyBindings

ASCII-text module for writing LARGE text for the previewer
http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Sweet&t=I'm%20cool
http://www.network-science.de/ascii/

Open files dropped into the editor!!!

Debugger integration! No more console.log debugging!
When in dev-mode, you can just place a break-point and the program will stop there and you can see all the variable values, like in the debugger.

When hitting F5 and the file starts with "#!/usr/bin/env node".
Run node with debugger and when there is an error, go to that line and display the error message!
If there is no error, open a new file with the stdout.

Broadcast to local network that you are working on a spcific file. If someone else have the same file open, you can colaborate, and you get each others changes.
You can also open up another copy of the editor locally (for split screen) and make changes to the same document. (how to do Ctrl+Z ?)


cmsjz live preview!

Make a better document preview ...

Being able to split the same file into two views so you can look at two parts of the same file at once.

Key binding for: put the selected text in clipboard and put the cliboard instead of the selected text.

Drop files into the editor to open them.

Different themses during day/night (sun up/down). Black on white is best when the room is light, but if the room is dark, a black background also works!
Light bounce off light colors, that's why you can't have light text when it's light, or the text will seem blurry.
Light also makes the eye focus more. And contrast will atttract most focus.

Gameification, skinners box, highscore, get more points the more time you spend in the editor. Achemenets (for duing unusual stuff) and rewards (thropfies!?)

When caret is next to {, make everything orange down to matching }

When selecting several rows and hitting tab, make it a block by inserting { selection }


FTP/SSH module!!

Fullscreen mode.

Auto insert } outside of strings or regexp when typing {. And only if there is an un-match.
Auto insert matching } at the Right place! For example when encapsulating code in an if-statement.

Ctrl + D to declare a variable, add it to first var declaration above!?
Color undeclared (global) variables in an evil color.

When the cursor is on a } show a split screen with the matching {

A key to toggle scope-coloring.

Drag and drop files into the editor.

Bootstrap: nw.js project, web-page, etc. Create all the kakakaka

Check for .editorconfig and set default indent_size, etc: http://EditorConfig.org

Replace in function

Tool to create text bitmap, so that font looks the same in all OS's. Problem: Background colors! Might have to redo the text renderer!

test bitmap fonts to see if it's faster: Result: its 3 times faster without bitmaps.

Smooth scrolling. Make it easier to read text while scrolling.

When ctrl+z, move the caret to before the text being removed. For every action, create an undo-action.



Need though
-----------
How should plugin do with CSS? Have their own CSS file!?

make a full render when messing with indentation!?

A list of code comments for easier code navigation, click on the code to go to it. Ett kompliment till function-list.
